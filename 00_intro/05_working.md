# <center>How Javascript Works</center>

    Initially Javascript is invented to work in browsers

## V8 and Spider Monkey
    V8 and spider monkey are the javascript engines that compiles and runs javascript in the browser

    v8           :: Chrome
    spidermonkey :: Firefox

## NodeJS and DenoJS
    These are the Javascript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser
